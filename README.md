# Mastermind Backend

This is still a work in progress.

However, once I've written the code, this will be how you can run it locally:

- `git clone https://github.com/caitp222/mastermind-backend.git`
- `cd mastermind-backend`
- `rails s`
- `bundle install`
- `rails db:create && rails db:migrate`
- It will run on localhost:3000 by default.
